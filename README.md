Monkey Scripting Language
=========================

This is my implementation of the Monkey scripting language as presented in the book [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) by [@ThorstenBall](https://twitter.com/thorstenball)

### Example Monkey Script
```
let a = [1, 2, 3];
let add = fn(a, b) { a + b };

let sum = add(a[0], a[2]);

print("Holy cow it works!", "The sum is ", sum);
```
